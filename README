clipperz2passwordsafe
=====================

A PHP script that converts a JSON file exported from Clipperz 
to a XML that can be imported by Password Safe. Written by
Hans F. Nordhaug - <hansfn@gmail.com>.

Usage: php clipperz2passwordsafe.php [utf8encode] json-file xml-file

The script tries to handle the fact that a Clipperz card can contain
many username and passwords pairs. It also tries to warn when
data is skipped because a Password Safe entry is less flexible
than a Clipperz card.

The script is NOT intended to be run on a webserver, because uploading
the JSON file with all your unencrypted passwords is very high risk.

The script is placed in the public domain.
